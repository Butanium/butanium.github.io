I am Computer Science Master student at École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay. My main research interest is technical AI alignment.
I'm currently doing a research internship at [EPFL DLAB](https://dlab.epfl.ch/) under the supervision of [Chris Wendler](https://x.com/wendlerch?t=6EhNGC5XfB2GhU5BrF8K0A&s=09) and [Bob West](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/). We're working on a follow up of the [Do Llamas work in English paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588).

Before starting this internship I was exploring the emergence of XOR features in Large Language Models and the [RAX hypothesis](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hjJXCn9GsskysDceS/what-s-up-with-llms-representing-xors-of-arbitrary-features) proposed by Sam Marks.

You can find my other projects on my [CV](/cv) or [Github](https://github.com/butanium).

I am also fascinated by evolutionary biology, its manifestation in artificial life simulations, and am an improvisor at the ENS improv theater club Lika. Feel free to message me if you want to get in touch!
