I'm a Computer Science Master's student at École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay. This year, I'm pursuing the MVA (Vision & Learning Master's degree). My main research interest is technical AI alignment.

I'm an incoming MATS Winter 2025 Scholar with Neel Nanda. With Julian Minder, we'll work on model diffing between base and instruction-tuned LLMs.

Previously, I was fortunate to complete a research internship at [EPFL DLAB](https://dlab.epfl.ch/) under the amazing supervision of [Chris Wendler](https://x.com/wendlerch?t=6EhNGC5XfB2GhU5BrF8K0A&s=09) and [Bob West](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/). My main focus was interpretability, and I worked on a follow-up to the ["Do Llamas work in English?" paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588). [Our work](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0ku2hIm4BS) was selected as a spotlight presentation at the Mechanistic Interpretability Workshop at ICML 2025.

Before starting this internship, I was exploring the emergence of XOR features in Large Language Models and the [RAX hypothesis](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hjJXCn9GsskysDceS/what-s-up-with-llms-representing-xors-of-arbitrary-features) proposed by Sam Marks.

You can find my other projects on my [CV](/cv) or [GitHub](https://github.com/butanium).

I am also fascinated by evolutionary biology, its manifestation in artificial life simulations, and I am an improvisor at the ENS improv theater club Lika. Feel free to message me if you want to get in touch!
