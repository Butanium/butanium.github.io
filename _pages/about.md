I'm MATS Winter 2025 (7.0) Scholar with Neel Nanda. With [Julian Minder](https://jkminder.ch/), we're currently working on evaluating different <span class="tooltip">model diffing<span class="tooltiptext">Model diffing is the study of mechanistic changes introduced during fine-tuning - essentially, understanding what makes a fine-tuned model different from its base model internally.</span></span> methods.

I'm completing my MSc in Vision & Learning (MVA) at École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay. My main research interest is technical AI alignment.

Previously, I was fortunate to complete a research internship at [EPFL DLAB](https://dlab.epfl.ch/) under the amazing supervision of [Chris Wendler](https://wendlerc.github.io/) and [Bob West](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/). My main focus was interpretability, and I worked on a follow-up to the ["Do Llamas work in English?" paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588). [Our work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08745v1) was selected as a spotlight presentation at the Mechanistic Interpretability Workshop at ICML 2025.

Before starting this internship, I was exploring the emergence of XOR features in Large Language Models and the [RAX hypothesis](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hjJXCn9GsskysDceS/what-s-up-with-llms-representing-xors-of-arbitrary-features) proposed by Sam Marks, did SPAR with Walter Laurito, worked on a project with [Jobst Heitzig](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Z9P2m462wQ4qmH6uo/aspiration-based-q-learning) on non-maximizing training objectives for RL agents, and attended the ML4G AI safety bootcamp.

You can find my other projects on my [CV](/cv) or [GitHub](https://github.com/butanium).

I am also interested in evolutionary biology, its manifestation in artificial life simulations, and I am an improvisor at the ENS improv theater club Lika. Feel free to message me if you want to get in touch!
