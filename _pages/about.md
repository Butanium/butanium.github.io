I am Computer Science Master student at ENS Paris-Saclay. My main research interest is technical AI alignment. Currently, I am focused on eliciting latent knowledge from reinforcement learning agents as a [SPAR](https://berkeleyaisafety.com/spar) student.

I am also fascinated by evolutionary biology and its manifestation in artificial life simulations and an improvisor at the ENS improv theater club Lika.
