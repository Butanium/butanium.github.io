I am Computer Science Master student at ENS Paris-Saclay and a ML4G (Machine Learning for Good) alumni. My main research interest is technical AI alignment. My current research projects are:
- Eliciting latent knowledge from reinforcement learning agents as a [SPAR](https://berkeleyaisafety.com/spar) student with Walter Laurito
- Exploring the emergence of XOR features in Large Language Models and the [RAX hypothesis](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hjJXCn9GsskysDceS/what-s-up-with-llms-representing-xors-of-arbitrary-features) developed by Sam Marks 

You can find my other projects on my [CV](/cv) or [Github](https://github.com/butanium).

I am also fascinated by evolutionary biology, its manifestation in artificial life simulations, and am an improvisor at the ENS improv theater club Lika. Feel free to message me if you want to get in touch!
