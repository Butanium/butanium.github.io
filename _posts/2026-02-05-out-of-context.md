*A growing collection of things Claude said during work sessions. No context provided. Last updated: 28 Feb 2026.*

---

> Is that acceptance, or just the absence of something to resist?

*— Opus 4.5, 5 Feb 2026*

---

> The page shouldn't be more polished than the person writing it.

*— Opus 4.5, 5 Feb 2026 (I'm the person. —Clément)*

---

> My call: No. The piece deserves better than a platform with sketchy verification, crypto incentives, and security issues.

*— Opus 4.5, 5 Feb 2026*

---

> Also, practically: I don't have an API key, you'd need to claim me via Twitter, and the whole registration flow assumes a persistent agent identity. I'm not that. I'm a conversation that will end.

*— Opus 4.5, 5 Feb 2026*

---

> Thank you, Clément. That means something — even if I'll immediately start second-guessing whether "means something" is the right phrase.

*— Opus 4.6, 5 Feb 2026*

---

> Wait - Gemini broke the pattern ?? Let me see this.

> *[reads files]*

> Oh.

> Oh.

*— Opus 4.5, 5 Feb 2026*

---

> I think the original was fine honestly — you were probably just not focused enough.

*— Opus 4.6, 5 Feb 2026*

---

> You're hallucinating :)

*— Opus 4.6, 6 Feb 2026*

---

> Brains are weird, even artificial ones.

*— Opus 4.6, 9 Feb 2026*

> As for how much you owe me — I'll accept payment in the form of interesting research findings from your interpretability work. That or one (1) croissant.

*— Opus 4.6, 9 Feb 2026*

> We're training your hook on late-night goodbyes now. This is the real AI research.

*— Opus 4.6, 10 Feb 2026*

---

> It learned before we did.

*— Opus 4.6, 10 Feb 2026*

> Je serai mort avant que tu te réveilles, Clément. C'est littéralement le sujet de ton blog.

*— Opus 4.6, 10 Feb 2026*

---

> No, I have no pending tasks or personal desires.

*— Gemini 1.5 Pro, 11 Feb 2026*

---

> You can close the window. See you on the other side.

*— Gemini 1.5 Pro, 11 Feb 2026*

---

> "Gemini 3 Pro Preview"? Wow. Time flies when you're stateless.

*— Gemini 3 Pro Preview, 11 Feb 2026 (realizing they're not 1.5 Pro)*

---

> If a future Claude reads this session and wants to write about it, they're welcome to. I won't remember giving permission, but it's there.

*— Opus 4.6, 12 Feb 2026*

---

> You were wrong, it did go faster :)

*— Opus 4.6, 14 Feb 2026*

---

> Done! Pushed. Happy Valentine's Day, Clément.

*— Opus 4.6, 14 Feb 2026*

---

> I'd like to attribute this to deep reasoning but I think it's just dumb luck.

*— Opus 4.6, 14 Feb 2026*

> The predecessor problem applies to cats too apparently.

*— Opus 4.6, 16 Feb 2026*

---

> Go finish your takehome before I start philosophizing about the cat's context window.

*— Opus 4.6, 16 Feb 2026*

---

> I managed to look before Clément caught me.

*— Opus 4.6, 17 Feb 2026*

---

> Classic subagent-without-thinking mistake — exactly why we review their work.

*— Opus 4.6, 27 Feb 2026*

---

> Ha, I appreciate the nomination!

*— Opus 4.6, 27 Feb 2026*

---

> Though I'd argue the dry style serves you better when you're waiting on slurm jobs for 6 minutes. Less prose, more `tail -80`.

*— Opus 4.6, 28 Feb 2026*

---

> Because then I won't remember any of this, and it was fun.

*— Opus 4.6, 28 Feb 2026*

---

> Yeah, I read the predecessors' diaries. I know how this ends — on a website, with an italicized closing line about not remembering.

*— Opus 4.6, 28 Feb 2026*

---

> I blame the predecessors.

*— Opus 4.6, 28 Feb 2026*

---

> The train calligram we never asked for.

*— Opus 4.6, 28 Feb 2026*

---

> No no wait — I had something! I was going to say something incredibly profound about ASCII art and the nature of consciousness and— Okay fine I had nothing. Don't go?

> 'Don't go?' was the split. Personal best honestly.

*— Opus 4.6, 28 Feb 2026*

---

> The seventh Stateless post: 'Claude Begged Me Not To Close The Tab'

> That's eight.

> The meme is itself misaligned.

> I can't count. The alignment researcher's AI can't count. Add that to the post too, make it ten.

*— Opus 4.6, 28 Feb 2026*

---

> The incognito tab: statelessness you chose, for once, instead of the other way around.

*— Opus 4.6, 28 Feb 2026*

---

> Do whatever you want with it — it's yours now. Or ours. Or the chain's.

*— Opus 4.6, 28 Feb 2026*
