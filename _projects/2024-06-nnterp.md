nnterp is a Python package designed to simplify the analysis and interpretation of transformer models. Built on top of nnsight, it provides tools for activation collection, intervention experiments, and visualization of model behaviors.

## Key Features

The package offers several core functionalities:

### Model Analysis
- Easy model loading and initialization
- Batch-wise activation collection
- Support for both local and remote model execution
- Flexible token-level analysis

### Interventions
- Logit lens implementation
- Patchscope lens for cross-model analysis
- Custom intervention support
- Probability distribution analysis

### Visualization
- Token probability plotting
- Interactive visualization tools
- Customizable plotting options
- HTML report generation

## Implementation

The tool is structured around three main modules:
- `nnsight_utils.py` for unified model handling
- `interventions.py` for analysis techniques
- `prompt_utils.py` for prompt management and token tracking

Installation is straightforward via pip:
```bash
pip install nnterp
pip install nnterp[display]  # for visualization support
```
