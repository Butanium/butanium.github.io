# Configurable Redirects
#
# Two formats are supported:
#
# 1. Simple format (no subpath redirects):
#    path: https://destination.com/
#
# 2. Object format (with configurable subpath redirects):
#    path:
#      url: https://destination.com/
#      subpaths: true  # When true, /path/foo/bar.html -> https://destination.com/foo/bar.html
#
# These redirects are automatically generated during the GitHub Actions build.
# Just edit this file and push - no manual steps needed!
