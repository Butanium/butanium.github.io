title: "Satisficing Reinforcement Learning"
collection: research
permalink: /research/2023-09-10-satisficing-rl
excerpt: 'Inspired by satisficing, we introduce a novel concept of non-maximizing agents, א-aspiring agents, whose goal is to achieve an expected gain of א. We derive aspiration-based algorithms from Q-learning and DQN.'
